Description Manager is an Umbraco v10+ plugin for helping editors quickly update media items that are missing descriptions.

**What is a description?** That depends, an example could be an *Alt Description* on an Image, it could be a *Title* on a video. It all depends on the site.

**Why use this package?** If your media types in Umbraco has a field for it's "default" description, this package will give editors a quick overview for items where the property is not yet set.
